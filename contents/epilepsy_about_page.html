                <h3 class="dk-blue-bordered">The Knowledge Portal Framework</h3>
                <p>The Knowledge Portal framework is being developed as part of the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/research-training/accelerating-medicines-partnership-amp" target="_blank">Accelerating Medicines Partnership</a>, a public-private partnership between the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 10 biopharmaceutical companies, and multiple non-profit organizations that is managed through the Foundation for the NIH (FNIH). AMP seeks to harness collective capabilities, scale, and resources toward improving current efforts to develop new therapies for complex, heterogeneous diseases. The ultimate goal is to increase the number of new diagnostics and therapies for patients while reducing the time and cost of developing them, by jointly identifying and validating promising biological targets for several diseases, including type 2 diabetes.</p>
                <p>Knowledge Portals are intended to serve three key functions:<ol><li>To be central repositories for large datasets of human genetic information linked to complex diseases and related traits.</li><li>To function as scientific discovery engines that can be harnessed by the community at large, and assist in the selection of new targets for drug design.</li><li>Eventually, to facilitate the conduct of customized analyses by any interested user around the world, doing so in a secure manner that provides high quality results while protecting the integrity of the data.</li></ol></p>
                <p>Knowledge Portals are intended to be <i>secure</i>, <i>compliant</i> with pertinent ethical regulations, <i>accessible</i> to a wide user base, <i>inviting</i> to researchers who may want to contribute data and participate in analyses, <i>organic</i> in the continuous incorporation of scientific advances, <i>modular</i> in their analytical capabilities and user interfaces, <i>automated</i>, <i>rigorous</i> in the quality of data aggregation and returned results, <i>versatile</i>, and <i>sustainable</i>.</p>
